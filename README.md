# RockPaperScissorsGame
Hello, guys! This is my first project here and I am just starting to study how to program by myself, so I would love to receive some tips from you who are more experienced! 

In this program I just programmed a pretty basic, but cool game very well known here in Brazil. Here we call it "Pedra, Papel e Tesoura".

The idea is give to the computer and to the player 3 options to choice: Rock, Paper or Scissors.
Rock beats Scissors and loses to Paper;
Paper beats Rock and loses to Scissors;
Scissors beats Paper and loses to Rock.

So, to win the player needs to choose an object that beats the computer's choice.

The game was made in Brazilian Portuguese, but I bet we can translate it into English too.
